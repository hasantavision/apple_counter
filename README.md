If you need to run it on your environment, please make sure you install these

**Counting**
- pytorch > 2
- detectron2
- opencv

**Color classification**
- pytorch > 2
- detectron2
- opencv
- scikit-learn

dataset for training is in /data folder.
in the notebook, I use the link from my google drive so you can run the codes without the need to download manually.

# Training
I use Detectron2 to train Mask-RCNN with apple apple dataset.
The script for training is in utils. you can click link below to directly go to google colab.
